# t-SNE-geochemistry
This repository holds scripts demonstrating methods for the journal article "Geochemical characterisation of rock hydration processes using t-SNE" (submitted). The dataset used within the journal article is not open file, so a public chemical assay database has been used in this repository.

## How to use
The "examples/examples.R" file walks through the available functions with an open file chemical assay database (see https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/compositions/versions/1.40-1/topics/Hydrochem).

## Testing
The "examples/examples.R" file should create figures which match those in "examples/examples_out".
